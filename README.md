Adversarially Regularized Graph Autoencoder (ARGA)
============

This is a TensorFlow implementation of the Adversarially Regularized Graph Autoencoder(ARGA) model as described in our paper:
 
Pan, S., Hu, R., Long, G., Jiang, J., Yao, L., & Zhang, C. (2018). Adversarially Regularized Graph Autoencoder for Graph Embedding, [https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0362.pdf], published in IJCAI 2018: 2609-2615.

We borrowed part of code from T. N. Kipf, M. Welling, Variational Graph Auto-Encoders [https://github.com/tkipf/gae]
